REACT Native helps you create real and exciting mobile apps with the help of JavaScript only, which is supportable for both android and iOS platforms. Just code once, and the REACT Native apps are available for both iOS and Android platforms which helps to save development time. Found a great popularity and also backed by Facebook, REACT Native, has a huge community support today. React Native is built on top of ReactJS which has given a huge competition to the long time favorite, AngularJS.

React Native is a framework that builds a hierarchy of UI components to build the JavaScript code. It has a set of components for both iOS and Android platforms to build a mobile application with native look and feel. ReactJS, on the other hand, is an open source JavaScript library to create user interfaces. However, both React Native and ReactJS are developed by Facebook using the same design principles, except designing interfaces.
